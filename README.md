***Description of the room:***

Series of quick General Knowledge questions to check how good your memory is!

Getting better at using "Search Engines" in order to find the right answers in less time is an art. This room is all about quick challenges which most of the n00bs like me already have in mind and don't really require a "Google Search" but for some of the n00bs it is still remained to be learnt!

So these little challenges will be helping you a lot! Have fun!
